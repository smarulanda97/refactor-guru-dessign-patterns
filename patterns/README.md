# Design Patterns

They are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that allow customized them and solve a recurring design problem

## Creational Patterns

Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse existing code.

## Structural Patterns

Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Behavioral Patterns

Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

# Design principles

## Features of Good Design

Process of designing software architecture: things to aim for and things you'd better avoid.

### Code reuse

Cost and time are two of the most valuable metrics when developing any software product. Less time in development means entering the market earlier than the competitors. Lower development costs mean more money is left for marketing and a broader reach to potential customers.

*Code reuse* is one of the most common ways to reduce development costs.

The idea looks great on paper, but it turns out that making existing code work in a new context usually takes extra effort. 

### Extensibility

**Change** is the only constant thing in a programmer's life. That's why all seasoned developers try to provide for possible future changes when designing an application's architecture.
